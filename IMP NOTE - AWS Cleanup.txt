AWS Cleanup
One final reminder! If you've been following along with the hands-on exercises, some of the services we used are not free and will incur charges even if you aren't actively using them.

Log into your AWS account, and make sure:

Any EMR clusters are terminated

Any Redshift clusters are terminated

Any Kinesis Streams and Firehose Delivery Streams are deleted

Any Elasticsearch domains are terminated

Your Kinesis Analytics applications are deleted

Any SNS topics are deleted

Any EC2 instances are terminated

Your S3 bucket is deleted

QuickSight is not set up to auto-renew

You might want to give yourself a calendar reminder to check the Billing page in your AWS account in a few days to ensure all charges have stopped.
